# Summer_Research_2017

This is a collection of scripts and functions from my Summer 2017 research project under Dr. Tobin Driscoll at the University of Delaware.  The project was titled *Numerical Soltuions to Ordinary and Delay Differential Equations in Chebfun*. The purpose of this project was to apply the [Chebfun](http://www.chebfun.org/) library to ODEs and DDEs using the Picard and Newton itertative methods.

Check the `Functions` directory for function implementations that are used within the scripts.
